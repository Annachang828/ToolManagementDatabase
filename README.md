<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
  â€¢	Team worked with three classmates to create complex database applications, seamlessly integrating Microsoft Access with MS SQL and Oracle SQL Servers. <br>
  â€¢	Implemented PL/SQL to develop instead of triggers to manage user INSERTS, UPDATES, and DELETES, recording data changes with timestamps in Oracle.<br>
  â€¢	Made testing plan and generated test data to examine constraints and ensure triggers worked as required.<br>
